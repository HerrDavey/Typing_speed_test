<h1>Typing Speed Test Application ðŸ’»</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python application measures the typing speed of a user through a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter. The program calculates both the characters per minute (CPM) and words per minute (WPM) of the user as they type random words displayed on the screen. The application is ideal for users looking to improve their typing speed and accuracy.
<br />

<h2>Features</h2>

 - <b>Graphical User Interface</b>: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
 - <b>Typing Speed Metrics</b>: Calculates and displays characters per minute (CPM) and words per minute (WPM).
 - <b>Real-time Feedback</b>: Highlights words as they are typed correctly or incorrectly.
 - <b>Timer</b>: A 60-second countdown timer for each test session.
 - <b>Scoreboard</b>: Saves the best scores for future reference.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

 - <b>Download Dictionary</b>: The application checks and downloads the NLTK words corpus if not already available.
 - <b>Initialize GUI</b>: Sets up the main window, including text display areas, input fields, and labels for metrics.
 - <b>Start Typing Test</b>: The test begins when the user starts typing. The timer counts down from 60 seconds.
 - <b>Real-time Typing Feedback</b>: Words are highlighted in green if typed correctly or red if typed incorrectly.
 - <b>Calculate Metrics</b>: At the end of the test, the application calculates CPM and WPM based on the user's input.
 - <b>Save Best Scores</b>: The best scores for CPM and WPM are saved to a JSON file for future reference.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>: Tkinter, nltk, time
